# Styleguide

This guide defines the basic principles and templates of the ```cividi``` visual language in regards to maps, diagrams and other visual outputs.

## Maps

Many of ```cividi's``` publicly visible activities are based on maps. A ```cividi``` map should be

* **easy** to read and understand
* have **accessible colors**
* be **responsive**
* show the relevant **context**
* expose only the relevant user interaction
* be open (cf. [open definition](https://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/))
* a self contained, reproducable package (cf. [map data package](maps/map-setup.md#mdp))
* tell a story

## Diagrams

Diagrams should be treated as ```data driven documents```. To help this effort ```cividi``` is building up a library for urban data diagrams. In reference to projects like [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) based on [D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3).
