# Styleguide

This guide defines the basic principles and templates of the ```cividi``` visual language in regards to maps, diagrams and other visual outputs.

## Maps

Many of ```cividi's``` publicly visible activities are based on maps. A ```cividi``` map should be

* **easy** to read and understand
* have **accessible colors**
* be **responsive**
* show the relevant **context**
* expose only the relevant user interaction
* be open (cf. [open definition](https://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/))
* a self contained, reproducable package (cf. [map data package](maps/cividi-maps.md#mdp))

A minimal map can be setup by running the following code.
