# Map Setup

## mdp

Map Data Packages are built on top of the Frictionless Data [Datapackage Standard for Geodata](https://frictionlessdata.io/docs/publish-geo/). This document is a living document on the path to specify how standards for map data packages should look like. Libraries like smartuse-gl should be able to rely on mdp as an input to render maps accordingly and in complience with the styleguide.

### File-Structure
